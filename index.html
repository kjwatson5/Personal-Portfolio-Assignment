            <h4>After graduating high school I had planned to make a full career out of the Army.
                Three days after I turned 18 I signed my Army contract, and was super excited for this journey.
                However, plans made a sudden change when an incident happened during infantry training which resulted in
                a medical discharge.

            <h2>What Did I Do Next?</h2>

        <div class="main-details">
            <h4>About six months after I got out of the Army I got a blue collar job in a factory. This is where I currently work
                when I'm not doing school. The factory I work in manufactures the material to put together steel buildings.
                I work around 50-60 hours a week, but it keeps my family fed while I chase the career I want which brings us to our
                next topic.

                <h2>My Dream Career</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="main-details">
                <h4>My interest in coding sparked when my grandfather took a college
                    course in coding when I was younger. Since then I've always had a love for working with computers,
                    and definitely sparked an interest in wanting to learn how to code. I started out just learning fun command prompt
                    commands and when I saw an add on Facebook about software engineering schooling I started doing research.
                    Research showed me I could make good money in something I was genuinely interested in so I jumped right in.
                    To me it is absolutely amazing that a few months ago I couldn't write a single line of code and now I can code
                    this entire website! Now I know exactly what I want to do for my future career.
